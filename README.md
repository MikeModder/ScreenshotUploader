# ScreenshotUploader

### What is this?
It's a simple Android app (written in Kotlin) that automatically uploads screenshots from your Android device.

### How can I built?
If there's no [releases](https://github.com/MikeModder/ScreenshotUploader/releases) and you still want to use this, I'm sure you can figure out how to build it.

### Why?
I like playing around, and this is a good way to learn some Android and Kotlin, so yeah.
